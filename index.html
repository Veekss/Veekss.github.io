	<p>I am currently using NotePad++ as my text editor.</p>
	<p>Chapter 1 shows a way for you to design a webpage and shows all the elements into making one, Before coding a website, you must first create a wireframe and site map. Next, you need to consider several design elements, such as graphics, navigation, and color. Finally, you must also plan for accesibility.</p>
	<p>After reading Chapter 1, I know how to download and use a text editior to create HTML page. I know which HTML elements are required to create a basic HTML webpage.
