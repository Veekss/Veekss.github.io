                <h2>Sticky</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a sticky position. Its position is based on the user's scroll position.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to briefly explain how to use the sticky position. -->
                <p> The element sticky is used as you scroll down and the pages follow.</p>

            <div class="box relative">
                <h2>Relative</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a relative position. It can move around a little, depending on the viewport, but it is in a position relative to itself.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and left properties and how it affected the relative box. -->
                <p>It consists of pixels top and left to move the realtive box. Top 100 and 900 pixels left to move the box center of my screen.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="box fixed">
                <h2>Fixed</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a fixed position. Its position is relative to the viewport.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and right properties and how it affected the fixed box. -->
                <p>Top and right consists 100px right and top 90px. It changed it by moving it right and when you scroll it stays there where its sent to be </p>

            <div class="box absolute">
                <h2>Absolute</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with an absolute position. It is similar to the fixed position; however, it is positioned relative to the closest parent element.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the bottom and right properties and how it affected the absolute box. -->
                <p>It holds 0 values for bottom and right this made the pages at the bottom and to the right. So it changed the box to the bottom right.</p>
